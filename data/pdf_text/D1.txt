Claiming for Your out-patient, dental and other expenses

In this case, follow these steps:

1. Receive Your medical treatment and pay the medical provider.

2. Get an invoice from Your medical provider. (This should state Your name, treatment date(s), the
diagnosis/medical condition that You received treatment for, the date of onset of symptoms, the nature of the
treatment and the fees charged.)

3. Claim back Your eligible costs via Our MyHealth app or online portal (www.allianzcare.com/en/myhealth).
